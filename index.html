    " data-description="Machine Learning hackathon on AI for social good in collaboration with Kaizen 2024.
The problem statement for this Hackathon revolved around developing Machine Learning models capable of detecting and identifying claims in social media posts. It was hosted on Kaggle. The participants had to work on two critical tasks:
Claim Detection: The first task involved binary classification, where participants had to determine whether a given piece of text from a social media post is making a claim or not. 
Claim Span Identification: It is a critical task in the process of fact-checking and misinformation analysis, focusing on precisely locating the specific segment of text that constitutes a claim within a larger body of text.
Students had to work in teams to solve the problem statement.
We saw a huge interest from students and participation from within and outside IIT Delhi. There were 300+ registrations and we had 50+ amazing submissions. The top 3 submissions based on a weighted score were awarded prizes.
